# This file defines a parent class and its children by
# (1) setting the class;
# (2) defining methods, using setMethod();
# (3) setting the validators; and
# (4) establishing the constructors (i.e., functions called by users)
# where only the constructors are documented using roxygen.

# setClass: ----
# Classes are not currently exported, and therefore, do not need documentation.
# See the following link if we do want to document them in the future:
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7368262/how-to-properly-document-s4-class-slots-using-roxygen2

# Constructors ----
# All constructors in this file are documented in 1 roxygen file via @rdname.

#' Class constructors for `FIMSOutput` and associated child classes
#'
#' All constructor functions take a single input and build an object specific to
#' the needs of each model type within \pkg{FIMS}. `FIMSOutput` is the
#' parent class and the associated child classes have additional slots needed
#' for each model type.
#' @export
#' @rdname FIMSOutput
#' @param data A `data.frame` that contains the necessary columns
#'   to construct a output of FIMS of a given `FIMSOutput-class`.
#' @return An object of the S4 class `FIMSOutput` or one of its child classes
#' is validated and then returned. All objects will at a minimum have a slot
#' called `data` to store the input data frame. Additional slots are dependent
#' on the child class. Use [showClass()] to see all available slots.
